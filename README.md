Approach:

  Baseline Model Establishment,  
  Batch Size and Epoch Tuning,
  Learning Rate Tuning with ReduceLROnPlateau, and
  Early Stopping and Final Tuning


  Overall Strategy

My code follows a systematic approach to improving validation accuracy by:

Establishing a baseline: I followed that  create a base model for comparison.
Tuning key hyperparameters: I methodically adjust batch size and epochs to optimize training.
Dynamic learning rate adjustment: You employ the ReduceLROnPlateau callback to dynamically control the learning rate.
Preventing overfitting with early stopping: I  use EarlyStopping to stop training at the optimal point and prevent overfitting.
Iterative refinement: I continue to refine other hyperparameters based on observed performance.
