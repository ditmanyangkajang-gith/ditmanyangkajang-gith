Approach:
1. Import necessary libraries,
2. Load the MobileNetV2 model,
3. Add custom classification layers,
4. Create the final model,
5. Compile the model, and
6. Train the model.

   Reasonably; MobileNet is a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network architecture, making it suitable for training on datasets with limited computational resources. Therefore, base on my training approah, the test Accuracy is 92.68%. This accuracy best suit my training fro a given datasets.
